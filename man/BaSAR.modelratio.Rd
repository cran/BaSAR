\title{BSA model comparison}
\description{Function for model comparison with background trends using model ratios.}
\usage{
BaSAR.modelratio(data, start, stop, nsamples, nbackg1, nbackg2, interval)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{data as a 1-dimensional vector}
  \item{start}{lower limit of period of interest, in seconds}
  \item{stop}{upper limit of period of interest, in seconds}
  \item{nsamples}{number of samples within the interval start-stop}
  \item{nbackg1}{number of background functions to be added to 1st model}
  \item{nbackg2}{number of background functions to be added to 2nd model}
  \item{interval}{interval between data points, in seconds}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The model ratio between 1st model, \eqn{H_i}, and the 2nd model, \eqn{H_j}, will be calculated as
\deqn{ {{P(H_i | D,I)}\over {P(H_j | D,I)}} = {{P(H_i | I) P(D | H_i,I) } \over  {P(H_j | I) P(D | H_j,I)}}.   }

where model \eqn{H_i} is the one with fewer background functions. When the ratio > 1, model \eqn{H_i} is a better fit than model \eqn{H_j}.

Legendre polynomials are used for the background functions, and are scaled to be orthogonal over the data.

Plot log of posterior probability distribution and visually inspect if there are additional frequencies present. If they are, \code{\link{BaSAR.nest}} should be used instead for model comparison.

\value{
A list containing:
\item{normp}{1D normalized posterior distribution over omega}
\item{omega}{1D vector of the omega sampled}
\item{stats}{list of statistics from the probability distribution}
\item{ratio}{ratio between 1st model and 2nd model}
