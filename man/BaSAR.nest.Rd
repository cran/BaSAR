\description{BSA using nested sampling to calculate the evidence.}
\usage{
BaSAR.nest(data, start, stop, nsamples, nbackg, interval, nposts)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{data as a 1-dimensional vector}
  \item{start}{lower limit of period of interest, in seconds}
  \item{stop}{upper limit of period of interest, in seconds}
  \item{nsamples}{number of samples within the interval start-stop}
  \item{nbackg}{number of background functions to be added to the model}
  \item{interval}{interval between data points, in seconds}
  \item{nposts}{number of samples to draw from the posterior}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
Nested sampling is a variant of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and repeatedly samples the posterior by ranking the sample points by their likelihoods. This function will return the evidence, which can be used to directly evaluate models. A model with a higher evidence should be preferred. 

\code{\link{BaSAR.nest}} should be preferred over the functions \code{\link{BaSAR.auto}} and 
\code{\link{BaSAR.modelratio}} when there are multiple frequencies present in the data. This is because the model comparison in the mentioned functions is based on a local integration around the point of maximum likelihood, and this approximation is not valid when there are several high peaks in the posterior. Calculating the evidences and comparing those is then a better approach.

# Create time series with omega = 0.5 and 0.3, plus noise

# Run BaSAR with nested sampling to estimate mean omega and evidence
